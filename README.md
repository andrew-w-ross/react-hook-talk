# react-hooks mixins done right

Thanks for coming to the talk, here are my notes.

To check out the talk run `yarn && yarn start`

To check out the tests go into the `test-example` folder and run `yarn && yarn test`.

Don't worry about all the red, it's from the test where we check that it throws.

To checkout the counter example go into `example` folder and run `yarn && yarn start`.

I use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) as my test framework.

The vscode plugin I used to do live testing is [wallabyjs](https://wallabyjs.com/).

And the testing library I wrote for testing hooks is [test-react-hooks](https://github.com/andrew-w-ross/test-react-hooks).

Try it out, give it a star if you like it and raise an issue if you find any problems.
